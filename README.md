## Goals

In this tutorial I will be diving into more Dart programming concepts and learning how to use open source Flutter packages. By the end of this module, I will have become more comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.

## What I learned

- How to incorporate open source libraries of code into your project using Flutter Packages.
- How to play sound on iOS and Android.
- How to generate repeated user interface Widgets.
- How to use Dart functions that can take input arguments as well as return an output.
- Dart arrow syntax for writing one line functions.
